A simple script that utilizes PRAW to find the hottest post of /r/wallpapers and set it as your desktop wallpaper.

How to use:
1. Install the praw API 
1. Go to https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/ and create a personal script
2. Create a praw.ini file in the directory you placed the script in
3. In your praw.ini, set the parameters (you can read more about praw.ini here: https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/configuration/prawini.html)

Because this is a simple script, here is what it should look like.
